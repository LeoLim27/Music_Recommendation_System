This project is done in CS2010 class at Florida Tech.

This program recommend music to a target customer based on another customer's rating with their taste.

The program takes music rating files (including a target customer at the first line and other customer's ratings), 
and a list of actions file (add a new customer and recommend song for a target customer).

The distance from a target customer is calculated based on the rating information and stored in the priority queue.

Music is recommended if the closest customer has ratings on the music that target customer did not rate, and those ratings are greater than 3.
